# Capstone-project -SpaceX-IBM Data Science
Capstone project in data science
In this capstone, we will predict if the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully. SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. Therefore if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch. First we  will collect and make sure the data is in the correct format from an API. Here we collected data from core,launchsite,payload,apis and saved it to pandas dataframe. we taken required colums and group by falcon9 rocket. we check null values in data frame. we replace payloadmass null values with its mean values and saved it to csv as dataset1.csv format.we  performed web scraping to collect Falcon 9 historical launch records from a Wikipedia page titled List of Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy launches

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Falcon\_9\_and_Falcon_Heavy_launches
we collected data through webscraping.using following link
static_url = "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_Falcon_9_and_Falcon_Heavy_launches&oldid=1027686922" first using get we got response and created object using beautifulsoup. we extracted tables and created empty launch_dict and added all coluumns values and converted into dataframe and finally export it to csv file for furthey analysis.
Next we  performed some Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to find some patterns in the data and determine what would be the label for training supervised models.

In the data set, there are several different cases where the booster did not land successfully. Sometimes a landing was attempted but failed due to an accident; for example, True Ocean means the mission outcome was successfully landed to a specific region of the ocean while False Ocean means the mission outcome was unsuccessfully landed to a specific region of the ocean. True RTLS means the mission outcome was successfully landed to a ground pad False RTLS means the mission outcome was unsuccessfully landed to a ground pad.True ASDS means the mission outcome was successfully landed on a drone ship False ASDS means the mission outcome was unsuccessfully landed on a drone ship.

we  mainly convert those outcomes into Training Labels with 1 means the booster successfully landed 0 means it was unsuccessful.
Each launch aims to an dedicated orbit, and here are some common orbit types:

LEO: Low Earth orbit (LEO)is an Earth-centred orbit with an altitude of 2,000 km (1,200 mi) or less (approximately one-third of the radius of Earth),[1] or with at least 11.25 periods per day (an orbital period of 128 minutes or less) and an eccentricity less than 0.25.[2] Most of the manmade objects in outer space are in LEO \[1].

VLEO: Very Low Earth Orbits (VLEO) can be defined as the orbits with a mean altitude below 450 km. Operating in these orbits can provide a number of benefits to Earth observation spacecraft as the spacecraft operates closer to the observation\[2].

GTO A geosynchronous orbit is a high Earth orbit that allows satellites to match Earth's rotation. Located at 22,236 miles (35,786 kilometers) above Earth's equator, this position is a valuable spot for monitoring weather, communications and surveillance. Because the satellite orbits at the same speed that the Earth is turning, the satellite seems to stay in place over a single longitude, though it may drift north to south,‚Äù NASA wrote on its Earth Observatory website \[3] .

SSO (or SO): It is a Sun-synchronous orbit also called a heliosynchronous orbit is a nearly polar orbit around a planet, in which the satellite passes over any given point of the planet's surface at the same local mean solar time [4] .

ES-L1 :At the Lagrange points the gravitational forces of the two large bodies cancel out in such a way that a small object placed in orbit there is in equilibrium relative to the center of mass of the large bodies. L1 is one such point between the sun and the earth \[5] .

HEO A highly elliptical orbit, is an elliptic orbit with high eccentricity, usually referring to one around Earth \[6].

ISS A modular space station (habitable artificial satellite) in low Earth orbit. It is a multinational collaborative project between five participating space agencies: NASA (United States), Roscosmos (Russia), JAXA (Japan), ESA (Europe), and CSA (Canada) \[7]

MEO Geocentric orbits ranging in altitude from 2,000 km (1,200 mi) to just below geosynchronous orbit at 35,786 kilometers (22,236 mi). Also known as an intermediate circular orbit. These are "most commonly at 20,200 kilometers (12,600 mi), or 20,650 kilometers (12,830 mi), with an orbital period of 12 hours \[8]

HEO Geocentric orbits above the altitude of geosynchronous orbit (35,786 km or 22,236 mi) \[9]

GEO It is a circular geosynchronous orbit 35,786 kilometres (22,236 miles) above Earth's equator and following the direction of Earth's rotation \[10]

PO It is one type of satellites in which a satellite passes above or nearly above both poles of the body being orbited (usually a planet such as the Earth \[11]
Here we calculated value counts of orbits,succces rate and we give dummy variables of 0,1 to launch succes and failure and saved it to csv file.Here we download dataset and manually upload into database by changing date format. Now by using Db2 credentials we connect link to database from jupyter notebook. then we run sql quieries to solve problems.
